The once small and scrawny fox was no more, now he was a towering 8ft tall, 626lbs nine-tailed fox. This sudden change was enough to make him retire from adventuring until he fell more comfortable on his new frame, that took a decade. During that time he decided to follow his dream of opening and inn, the \\\\\\\"Foxes Nap\\\\\\\". Nowadays his size and weight do not hinder him in his roguish ways, even though he get stuck in smaller spaces more times that he is willing to admit. Due to his increase in size, he likes to wear clothes that are easy to move in, loose and with a large amount of pockets to put trinkets and items on.",
					"In general he is an easy going person, quick to help anyone who is in need and with a sly smile. Generally annoyed that his new appearance is overwhelming to others, even intimidating, but really he is a caring soul under all that .Hard to anger, but if you do, beware, his fey blood make him an vindictive bastard, and pray to whatever god you follow if he discover you are a slaver, his wrath will be brutal and swift. Don't break his trust on you, HE WILL REMEMBER.",

If a fight is brewing in his in he will use one of his illusions to halt them, just for a bit so he can safeguard the expensive drinks he have behind the counter, and that he will only tolerate non lethal fighting, if someone is going for the kill he WILL get involved."
